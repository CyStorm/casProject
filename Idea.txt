Managebac Mobile app is suck, so we make app for (not only) IB students to do shit, like track
marks, assignments, tests, and all that shit. Basically a more user friendly UI and features
for students unlike conventional calender apps or managebac moblie app which lacks features.
Just make framework now we can add new features as we go. Like helpful resource links,
other features can come natually.
